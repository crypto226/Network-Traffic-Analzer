# Network-Traffic-Analzer
The Network Traffic Analyzer is a Python-based project designed to capture, monitor, and visualize live network traffic in real time. Using Scapy for packet sniffing and Plotly Dash for interactive visualization, this tool helps users understand bandwidth consumption, protocol distribution, and detect unusual network activity. It supports multiple network interfaces and displays key metrics such as IP addresses, ports, packet counts, and data volume per protocol.

The goal of this project is to provide a lightweight, open-source solution for students, developers, and cybersecurity enthusiasts to explore network analytics and traffic behavior. It can be used for security monitoring, traffic diagnostics, or simply to learn about how data flows in a local network.
